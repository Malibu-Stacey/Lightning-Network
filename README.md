# Lightning Network ![Lightning Network Flaws](lightning-risk.png "Lightning Network")

**WARNING: If you try to use the Lightning Network (LN) you are at HIGH RISK of losing funds and it is not recommended or safe to do at this time or for the foreseeable future.**

*Below is a list which shows that Lightning Network has been drowning in technical issues, bugs, flaws, critiques, and exploits. It's over-promised tech that doesn't deliver on decentralization and a long ways from being functional and safe for users.*

April 13, 2021: Video discussion with LN engineer about pros and cons of LN. Tidbits include that LN transactions always require onchain transactions to be finalized/settled (problematic due to high fees), initial payment channels still an issue for new users, using LN service providers is a trust issue, not decentralized, using zero-conf to create channels is highly risky, must be online to use LN, constant backups needed so you don't lose funds, LN needs more forks to work (such as Taproot and El-Too) https://odysee.com/@DigitalCashNetwork:c/Lightning-Network:c

April 21, 2021: Popular Lightning wallet Phoenix had to shut down on-the-fly channel creations and other features due to high BTC transaction fees, which is another example of how poorly LN operates with a high fee base layer. https://archive.ph/RRzvU#high-mempool-size-impacts

October 4, 2021: Three new Lightning Network vulnerabilities were disclosed affecting multiple LN implementations. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in a wide range of attacks, going from fee blackmailing of node operators, burning liquidity of your competing LSPs or even stealing your counterparty channel balance if you avail mining capabilities. Exercise of the vulnerability revealed that a majority of the balance funds can be at loss. CVE-2021-41591/ CVE-2021-41592 / CVE-2021-41593 "Dust HTLC Exposure Considered Harmful." https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-October/003257.html

### 2022

February 21, 2022: Lightning Network faces many challenges, such as: 1) while technically two-party payment channels can exist off-chain forever, in practice they suffer from liquidity depletion bounding their lifetime, 2) two-party payment channels occupy significant block space per user when they get opened/closed, setting a bound on the number of LN users concurrently, and 3) multi-hop trust-minimized routing may cause even more channel closings (in-flight HTLCs leading to onchain claims).
